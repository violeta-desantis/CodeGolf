# Code Golf
A collection of C programs which complete various tasks/challenges using as few characters as possible.

Good coding practice holds no power here.
If the compiler isn't screaming warnings at you, you're doing it wrong. :)

As president, I organized a Code Golf event for the Drexel University IEEE-HKN Beta Alpha Chapter which was held on 3/9/2022.
